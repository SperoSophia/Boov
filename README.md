Simple Language Tool, that is used as the base of my compiler and script intepreation experiments. Now this is not going to provide
you with the entire toolchain to over take C#, Python or Ruby (Visual Basic ... most deffenetly)

Thats where the name comes from. The Movie "Boov" in which their language was constucted with minimal if not no grammar.
Yet able to understand and be able to become a 1'st class galactic civiliazation.

In other words:
To be able to write up some simple deffinitions of behavior can go a long way in comprehention.
Not to say that the boov can comprehend everything.
